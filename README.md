# diablo_guitar_site

A site for the fabricated guitar brand "El Diablo Guitarras"
My first site ever.
This is the first individual project assignment on the Front End Developer course at KYH, in Stockholm.
On this project I will use HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS.

Here is a link to the page: https://patrik-fredlund.github.io/diablo_guitar_site/
