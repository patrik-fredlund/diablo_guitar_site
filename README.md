# diablo_guitar_site

:books: A School Project. My First Site Ever!

A site for the fabricated guitar brand **"El Diablo Guitarras"** 

This is the first individual project assignment on the Front End Developer course at KYH, in Stockholm.
On this project I will use HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS.
